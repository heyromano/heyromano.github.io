# Hi, I'm Michael!

I am a cognitive scientist with research interests in embodied social cognition and applied ethics. My interdisciplinary research spans modes of inquiry in philosophy, ethnography, experimental psychology, and cognitive modeling. I use distributed cognition as a theoretical approach for integrating across multiple units of analysis and levels of explanation.

Questions my research explores include:
* How can we promote prosocial behavior in shared online spaces (e.g., social media, discussion forums, comment sections)?
* How can we document causal reasoning in traditional knowledge systems for two-way exchange (i.e., to preserve traditional knowledge and to transfer expertise to new domains)?
* How can attending to epistemological pluralism in the classroom increase diversity and inclusion in higher education?

      <h3>Prosocially Distributed Cognition</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Using distributed cognition as a theoretical framework, I study how situational micro-interventions in human-computer interaction (HCI) can promote prosocial behavior in online social spaces (e.g., social media, discussion forums, comment sections).</p>

      <h3>Embodied Ethnoecology</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Together with my colleagues in biology, environmental studies, and Mayan culture and language, I am co-developing a framework in embodied ethnoecology to document and model causal reasoning in traditional ecological knowledge.</p>

    <p>With my colleagues in anthropology, biology, and Tibetan Buddhist studies, I am co-developing a pedagogical framework that leverages existing epistemological pluralism in the classroom to teach across ways of knowing.</p>
