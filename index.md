# Hi, I'm Michael!

I am a cognitive scientist with interdisciplinary research interests in embodied cognition, prosocial behavior, and human-computer interaction (HCI). My projects are embedded in theories of embodied cognition, particularly distributed cognition, to enable a common research-design and modeling language for integrating across diverse units of analysis and levels of explanation in interdisciplinary research.

# Prosocially Distributed Cognition

Within the framework of distributed cognition, I study how situational micro-interventions in HCI can promote prosocial behavior in online social spaces (e.g., social media, discussion forums, comment sections).

# Embodied Ethnoecology

Together with my colleagues in biology, environmental studies, and Mayan culture and language, I am co-developing a framework in embodied ethnoecology to document and model causal reasoning in traditional ecological knowledge.

# Dialogue-Based Learning

With my colleagues in anthropology, biology, and Tibetan Buddhist studies, I am co-developing a pedagogical framework that leverages existing epistemological pluralism in the classroom to teach across ways of knowing.
