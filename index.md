  <h1>Hi, I'm Michael!</h1>
  <p>I am a cognitive scientist with research interests in embodied social cognition and applied ethics. My interdisciplinary research spans modes of inquiry in philosophy, ethnography, experimental psychology, and cognitive modeling. I use distributed cognition as a theoretical approach for integrating across multiple units of analysis and levels of explanation.</p>
